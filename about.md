I am Parth Verma, a third year student pursuing a dual degree (BSc + MSc) in Mathematics and Computing (batch of 2020) at IIT Kharagpur, India. I hail from Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, and currently residing at Vadodara, Gujarat.

I'm an open-source enthusiast who loves coding in C++, and Python. My best work till date is a project on Scrapy Benchmarking under GSoC 2017. I have been currently diving into the world of AI and ML, and have been doing some MOOCs on it. 

All my code is uploaded on my github profile [Parth-Vader](https://github.com/Parth-Vader), you can follow me there. I try to learn as many new technologies as possible, and create useful tools.

I am currently an Executive Head at [Kharagpur Open Source Society](http://kossiitkgp.in/), where we promote and teach others all about Open Source culture. We have organized workshops on Git, Ubuntu Install Fest, GSoC seminar among other workshops. 

I was also a part of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle research group at IIT Kharagpur, where I worked in the computer vision team.

I am a technology enthusiast, and I follow Hacker News and relevant subreddits in my free time.

I absolutely love listening to music. I also play Tabla.

As you can guess from my Github-nick, I'm a Star Wars fan. I specially enjoy Marvel and DC movies, and read about the various superheroes on their respective Wikis in my free time.

I enjoy watching TV series - Game of Thrones, Westworld, Black Mirror, Silicon Valley, and Rick and Morty being the (current) favourites.

I enjoy playing and following sports. I follow NBA regularly.
