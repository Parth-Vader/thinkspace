I have been selected for GSOC 2017 at Python Software Foundation to work on Scrapy Benchmarking Suite. This blog will serve as a medium for sharing my experience while working on the project. 

Link to my project : https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5840478256758784.

My github name is Parth-Vader which is based on the most powerful Sith Lord Darth Vader, and co-incidently the results came out on Star Wars Day (4th May).


MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.
