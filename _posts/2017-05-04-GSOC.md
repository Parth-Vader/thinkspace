I have been selected for GSOC 2017 at **Python Software Foundation** to work on Scrapy Benchmarking Suite. This blog will serve as a medium for sharing my experience while working on the project. 

Link to my project : [Scrapy Benchmarking Suite](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5840478256758784).

##Fun Fact

My github nick is [@Parth-Vader](https://github.com/Parth-Vader) which is based on the most powerful Sith Lord Darth Vader, and co-incidently the results came out on Star Wars Day (4th May).
